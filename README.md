# Building Recommendation system using Rule Based method and Market Basket Analysis
## Business Overview 
With the rapid expansion of e-business platforms across various industries, both the volume of user data and the duration of user engagement have grown significantly. This heightened interaction has driven the adoption of personalized customer experiences, which play a vital role in enhancing customer retention and ultimately contribute to sustained long-term revenue growth for companies.Recommender systems helps companies deliver this personalized customer experiences,improve customer satisfaction, and drive key performance metrics like sales, engagement, and retention.Recommendation systems use sophisticated algorithms to process large volumes of data and filter it based on various factors such as a user's purchase history, preferences, business rules, and product similarities.

In "Rule Based" recommenders, various rules such as popularity of the products, new product launches, discount and offers are considered when making recommendations to users. 
"Market Basket Analysis" uses algorithms such as 'Apirori' to understand the purchase behavior of users ( frequently bought itemsets in the same transaction) using association rules and recommend frequent itemsets to future users. It suses metrics such as support, confidence and lift to determine which are the frequently bought itemsets.
