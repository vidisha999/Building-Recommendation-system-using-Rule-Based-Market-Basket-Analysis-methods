# Building Recommendation system using Rule Based method and Market Basket Analysis
## Business Overview 
With the rapid expansion of e-business platforms across various industries, both the volume of user data and the duration of user engagement have grown significantly. This heightened interaction has driven the adoption of personalized customer experiences, which play a vital role in enhancing customer retention and ultimately contribute to sustained long-term revenue growth for companies.Recommender systems helps companies deliver this personalized customer experiences,improve customer satisfaction, and drive key performance metrics like sales, engagement, and retention.Recommendation systems use sophisticated algorithms to process large volumes of data and filter it based on various factors such as a user's purchase history, preferences, business rules, and product similarities.

In "Rule Based" recommenders, various rules such as popularity of the products, new product launches, discount and offers are considered when making recommendations to users. 
"Market Basket Analysis" uses algorithms such as 'Apirori' to understand the purchase behavior of users ( frequently bought itemsets in the same transaction) using association rules and recommend frequent itemsets to future users. It suses metrics such as support, confidence and lift to determine which are the frequently bought itemsets.

## Project overview 
This project uses a commedities dataset to build recommendation systems based on the both rules based method and market basket analysis technique. 
## Data 
The dataset contains transactional data collected from online retail company that sells unique all occasion gifts which occured between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011. Dataset can be found in the [UCL machine learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail). It contains information about 500k+ customers over eight attributes which are InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, Country.
## Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) 
Several customer based and item based insights were gained from the EDA.
Extracting Customer Insights from the dataset
1. The most loyal customers were from United Kingdom , top 10 loyal customers have made atleast 1600+ transactions and among them the top most loyal customer had made 7847 transactions.
2. The highest revenue generated by a single customer was approximately €280,000, originating from the Netherlands. The remaining customers in the top 10 category, were each contributing at least €77,000 in revenue and are from the United Kingdom, Australia, and Ireland (EIRE).
